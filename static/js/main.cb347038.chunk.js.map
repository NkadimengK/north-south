Areas notorious\r\n            for traffic congestions were now empty and those noise making cars\r\n            disappeared with the livelihoods of those who made a living through\r\n            servicing the city dwellers. Just like any organism fighting for\r\n            survival, cities did not simply give up their circulatory system.\r\n            They moved it underground. Traffic disappeared from the road and\r\n            peaked up on faster highways in the form of fibre optics. In that\r\n            process of changing lanes, existing but often hidden disparities\r\n            were exposed, and the inequities of our world found a new way of\r\n            self-expression through digital technology.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            When schools were transitioning to e-learning in South Africa, an\r\n            estimated{\" \"}\r\n            <a\r\n              href=\"https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/south-africa-children-school-drop-out-covid-19/\"\r\n              target=\"blank\"\r\n            >\r\n              750 000 students\r\n            </a>{\" \"}\r\n            dropped out due to the lack of resources required for distance\r\n            learning.

<br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 04 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>Modernism in visual arts is characterised by experimentation, abstraction, and lack of faithfulness to reality and more focus on the essence of that reality <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Modernism-art\" target=\"blank\">(Kuiper 2021)</a>. Post-modernism is the rejection of enlightenment <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy\" target=\"blank\">(Duignan 2020)</a>, the foundation of modernism and is a general suspicion of authority. In this article, I will argue that <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a> can be classified as modernist art and its purposes align with post-modern philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Google is not the internet, but it is a very good abstraction, and it is practically synonymous with the internet. It is therefore fitting to call this artefact <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>. To create meaning, the artist simply changed the orientation of google pages and left everything else to function the same</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Our perception of Google is of an archive of the truth. I cannot count how many times I have heard people say things like “I am telling you the truth; you can even google it”. By rotating the Google website, Constant Dullaart, the author of <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>, demonstrates to us that even Google can be manipulated. Bringing us to the postmodern view that there is no absolute truth. Truth is relative. Perhaps a good example of this concept can be demonstrated with a Google search. In 2018, the result of the search terms “squatter camps in South Africa” had many South Africans surprised because the results showed white people <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1306782/why-googling-squatter-camps-in-south-africa-returns-pictures-of-white-people/\" target=\"blank\">(Chuttel 2018)</a>. There are many struggling white people in South Africa; however, people expected the Google results to feature more black people because that is the reality on the ground. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>For someone in a foreign country who used the stated search terms without much knowledge about South Africa, the truth is, squatter camps are predominantly white. That is true and they have Google to prove it. Nobody stops to ask themselves how the search algorithms work and whose answers are likely to appear at the top. This goes back to the inequalities of internet access and online material contributions. The postmodernists believe that all forms of knowledge are functions of power. In this case, they are right.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Amazingly, such a simple concept of a rotating screen can have so much meaning. My own approach to internet art was partly inspired by <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>. I want to combine many basic ideas for a meaningful experience.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>References</h2>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>Kuiper, K. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Modernism-art\" target=\"blank\">Britannica.

My site is functional, navigation is good for mobile, and pc and I managed to make a satisfactory prototype of my internet art idea. I did however experience issues with the responsiveness of my art page and reusing code for my split-screen. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Process </strong>\r\n            <p>The priority was to get the basics working. That means functional navigation and responsiveness of the usual pages like <a href=\"index.html\" target=\"blank\">homepage</a> and <a href=\"blog.html\" target=\"blank\">blog entries</a>. Once that was working, I focused all my attention on internet art. For internet art the priority was functionality. I wanted to build a convincing and working minimum viable product. After a struggle, I finally pulled it off. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Struggle with responsiveness</strong>\r\n            <p>Responsiveness of the normal sections of the site was not that difficult. There were difficulties with getting the site to work just as well on mobile phones in landscape orientation. However, everything worked well for a portrait one. For the internet art page, there is a unique challenge. A split-screen of a mobile phone makes smaller square screens. Too small to give a similar computer experience. And it cannot give both portrait and landscape experiences of a mobile phone. A more optimal solution in the future may have to be completely different pages for the North and South sides in mobile. That is something I am currently considering.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>I also had issues with reusing code from the North in the South. The differences are small enough to be managed by two or three more variables. However, I had problems trying to give arguments to an onClick event. That meant I had to repeat the same code twice with a few variable name changes</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Achievements</strong>\r\n            <p>I eventually figured out how arguments work using event listeners. I successfully used the method on a few functions, but my internet art behaved differently. I still see that as a victory. I believe there is something small I was doing wrong without noticing and I will now have a chance to investigate it closely. A functional prototype of my internet art vision is also a big achievement for me. It functions exactly how I intended, and it was built using simple concepts. I also like the menu in the middle of the homepage road. It makes sense that to go anywhere on my site you must use the road. It also provides me with enough space for more things in the future.   </p>\r\n         \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TechnicalReflection;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/home.ec9c7ac7.PNG\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/home.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction ArtisticReflection({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Assignment 1 Artistic Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 03 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My life has so far proven to have unlimited reserves of artistic raw materials waiting to be mined. Just like many students I lead a life of two halves. One in the city, and then there is home during holidays. With almost two years under lockdown due to the pandemic, it should not matter much where I am, but it does. Turning these two worlds into one requires, at least in my case, a constant and affordable internet access. To use the internet at home the way I am now in Johannesburg would cost me the same if not more than the rent I am paying in the city. That is partly what I am trying to highlight with my internet art </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h3>Vision</h3>\r\n            <p>I do not just want to build a site as a pathway to my internet art. I want the website to be the art. The homogeneity must begin with the home page and spread with every page and content. My aim is to simulate the inequalities of the world we live in using the properties of the internet. I want to speak to the disparities of the Global North and the Global South, especially in the context of the creation of all technology tools that now run our lives. Unfortunately, as a South African, I do not have to travel the world to witness the implications of global inequality. I have samples scattered throughout the country. The North and the South are  <a href=\"https://unequalscenes.com/south-africa\" target=\"blank\">separated by a road</a> in South Africa. That is what I am building as an interactive internet experience. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Process</h3>\r\n            <p>Minimalism is the style guiding my process. I wanted to say as much as possible using as little as possible. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Homepage</strong>\r\n            <p>My homepage  made me appreciate just how difficult is it to make a good minimal design. My home page does not explicitly say what my project is about. But I wanted to use representations to inform the visitor. Starting with the name, my site is called North South. Which indicates polar opposites, and the global context of my project. I then use black and white colours and a tar road separating them. This is in reference to the racial inequalities in South Africa. The words standing out more than even the title is “ThisUnity in Diversity”. That is a word play on the South African motto, Unity in Diversity. However, I am trying to show Disunity. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Pages</strong>\r\n            <p>For blog pages I decided to stick to my minimalist idea. I keep the consistent black and white colours and just keep everything clean.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Internet Art</strong>\r\n            <p>With internet art I wanted to demonstrate how people living side by side have such a different online experience. Certain things look the same on the surface, but they are not. In the case of my project, you need to buy data to go through the pictures and to buy data you need money. In both the North and South you generate money by simply clicking on a button. However, you earn four times more in the North, data costs five times less and the internet is four times faster.  </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ArtisticReflection;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/proposal.638b7400.jpeg\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/proposal.jpeg\";\r\n\r\nfunction InternetArtProposal({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Internet Art Proposal</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Writing with a pen and paper\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Writing a proposal- Pexels</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 04 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <strong>Description </strong>\r\n            <p>My internet art is a simulation of inequalities that exist next to each other in many South African cities. It is also designed in reference to the disparities of the Global North and South.  I am using properties of the web to give an experience of two contrasting worlds existing directly next to each other. I will have a split-screen for the North and South. Users will be able to switch between the two and experience both sides. On the North side, the internet is cheaper and faster, and people make more money. On the South side is the opposite, the internet is expensive and slower, and people make less money. More activities and features will be added to make these differences more apparent. An optimal expression of my idea is turning it into a browser. That is, you can do almost all activities you normally do on the internet. But you are limited by the constraints I put in like loading times, lack of data, lack of money, load-shedding, general access restrictions, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Theoretical Focus</strong>\r\n            <p>My theoretical focus is on Internet, Society and Design Justice in the context of South Africa. The digital divide we are experiencing in South Africa mirrors historical inequalities, societal hierarchies, and exclusive urban planning. I am concerned with differences in data costs, hardware accessibility and infrastructure development. All these factors are a result of economic disparities and that is the picture I am trying to paint overall.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Style Guide and Reference Materials</strong>\r\n            <p>To give an idea of what I am trying to build, I have provided a prototype on the <a href=\"internet-art.html\" target=\"blank\">internet art page</a>. I have made a split-screen of the North and South. Users browse through images showing the type of environment I am simulating. But the browsing experience is different. Data in the North costs 2.5% of the salary, but in the South, it costs 50%. Internet in the South is four times slower than in the North.  That means you must wait four more seconds in the South to load one image. These types of differences will continue as the development of my website progresses.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Technical concerns and challenges foreseen</strong>\r\n            <p>Building my idea fully the way that I want to, as a normal browsing experience limited only by my constraints may prove more technically challenging even with the use of APIs. I may have to settle for designing and building the whole experience limited only to my website.  The best solution I have come up with is to simulate a normal browsing experience is to have my entire website as this split-screen. It is still challenging but doable. </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default InternetArtProposal;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/blog art.4f8ed314.PNG\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/blog art.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction UserGuide({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>User Guide – How to navigate North-South</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Glob page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>My Internet Art</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          \r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 07 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <p>North-South is an abstraction of inequalities of neighbouring areas in South Africa, often townships and suburbs.

The name is in reference to the Global North and Global South, a concept used to classify world countries based on their socio-economic and political characteristics.  Countries making up the Global North are wealthier, more politically stable, and less unequal. The Global South consists of poorer, unequal, and unstable countries. South Africa is somewhat unique; as an uncontested leader of inequality in the world, South Africa is structured like two countries divided along racial lines. A white country for the Global North and a black country in the Global South.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Slums occupied by black people and affluent suburbs formerly designated for white people exist side by side and still reflect historical demographics designed by the Apartheid state of South Africa. Without basic infrastructures such as electricity and telecommunication lines, internet access is multiple times more expensive in townships than in the neighbouring suburbs. People in the townships earn far less than their suburban counterparts; as a result, they spend a higher percentage of their earnings on internet connection.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My internet art is an abstract representation of this reality. The art is a model of a typical unequal area in South Africa. A model of the place's physical characteristics and an expression of a way of life accompanying these neighbouring contrasting areas. North-South is Sandton-Alexander and Primrose-Makause on the internet.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p>The stark black and white colours separated by small to no boundaries are the black and white neighbours of these areas, the rich and the poor, the digitally connected and the excluded groups. The North side of the website is designed to be relatively smooth and mire resourced, and the South side is made to be slow, frustrating, work-intensive with a high cost of operation. These are the daily realities of South Africans. </p>\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default InternetArtDescription;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/global-internet.026499b6.jpg\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/global-internet.jpg\";\r\n\r\nfunction GlobalInternet({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>The Need for Global Internet Connection -A close Reading</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"global internet picture\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>A connected world - Pixabay</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          \r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 07 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <p>For years the internet was seen as the solution to all problems the world faced due to physical, socio-political, and cultural barriers. True democracy was on the horizon. Free access to education offered by some of the world’s best educators. Free access to global markets for anyone anywhere on earth. In the internet world, the only limitation people would have to contend with would be themselves. But the internet had a far easier idea, to simply retrace inequalities of the past.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>According to Claire Daniolou there is only about 59% of the global population with internet access as of 2020 (Daniolou 2020). A further breakdown by UNESCO shows that “in the developed world, 87% are connected compared with 47% in developing nations, and just 19% in the least developed countries.” (Broom 2020) The historical parallels are not just international trends. Numbers from Stats SA 2019 report showed Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa with the highest internet penetration at 72.2% and Limpopo with only 42.4% of its population online (Stats SA 2019).</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Effects</strong>\r\n\r\n            <p>The differences in online presence result in greater inequality because, unlike Gauteng, a place like Limpopo will most likely “have larger populations with lower levels of educational attainment, lower-income, and more restricted access to healthcare and travel services”. (Daniolou 2020) In 2020, Ndlovu Youth Choir made many South Africans proud by reaching the finals of America’s Got Talent. The choir comes from a few kilometres away from my village, but I had to discover them with the rest of the world. These were supposed to be YouTube stars around the community, but digital isolation prevents such unique cultural products from flourishing, as Daniolou has correctly identified. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Action</strong>\r\n          \r\n            <p>Many originations, governments and businesses are working on solutions to bring broadband connectivity to rural areas (Daniolou 2020). I am particularly inspired by stories such as the one from Mankosi village in Eastern Cape. The University of Western Cape helped community members build an Internet Service Provider themselves, the first of its kind in South Africa, named Zenzele Network Providers – Zenzele means “do it yourself” in isiXhosa (Sikhakhane 2017). Help may or may not come, but those of us who are affected by issues must try solving them ourselves however we can. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Results</strong>\r\n           \r\n            <p>Zenzele Network Providers is now an established business, and community members buy vouchers to access the network at prices way below the national average. R30 will get you uncapped internet for a month. The opportunities for Mankosi residences are endless. The is no flaw in Daniolou statement that the internet “plays an imperative role in the business world” (Daniolou 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Dangers</strong>\r\n\r\n            <p>There is no doubt that “Online information can be misleading, so without a critical thinking, parts of the digital population can be manipulated” (Daniolou 2020). Some cases are nothing if not extraordinary. When Coronavirus began ravaging the world in 2020, people believed fake news linking the virus to 5G technology (Fransman 2021). But that was not a good enough leap; they went as far as attacking telecommunication towers. It is through education that such issues may be avoided. </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h2>References </h2>\r\n\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li> Daniolou, C. 2020. <a href=\"https://www.internetjustsociety.org/the-need-for-global-internet-connectivity\" target=\"blank\">Institute for Internet and the Just Society:  Digital Divide Widens.</a></li>\r\n                \r\n                <li> Broom, D. 2020.  <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-digital-divide-internet-data-broadband-mobbile/\" target=\"blank\"> Coronavirus has exposed the digital divide like never before.</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Stats SA. 2019. <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0318/P03182016.pdf\" target=\"blank\">STATISTICAL RELEASE P0318</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Sikhakhane, J. 2017. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-a-rural-community-built-south-africas-first-isp-owned-and-run-by-a-cooperative-87448\" target=\"blank\">How a rural community built South Africa’s first ISP owned and run by a cooperative</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Fransman, F. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/news24/columnists/guestcolumn/opinion-the-5g-effect-and-covid-conspiracies-why-these-notions-must-be-dispelled-20210408\" target=\"blank\">The 5G effect and Covid conspiracies: Why these notions must be dispelled</a></li>\r\n    \r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default GlobalInternet;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/Crowd2.c8bb9ec5.PNG\";","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/Crowd2.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction ExhaustingACrowd({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Analysis of Exhausting a Crowd</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Exhausting a Crowd in the Netherlands\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Exhausting a Crowd in the Netherlands</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          \r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 07 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <p>I am a believer in the idea that, in general, there are no socio-political solutions; there are only trade-offs. Walking around the streets of Braamfontein, I have never really felt safe, and I keep asking myself, what would I give up in exchange for security. Am I willing to give up some of my freedoms to state surveillance machinery in hopes of neutralising the criminal element roaming the streets with such ease? But this is where the nuance lies. Authorities do not ask for our willingness to be monitored; they just do it. Exhausting a Crowd is a reminder of that reality.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Judging by the camera positioning and location, scenes from Exhausting a Crowd would be classified as untargeted and ethically questionable public surveillance. South Africa introduced mass surveillance through the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication Related Information Act, or RICA, after the September 11 attacks in the United States (Duncan 2021). Such programs begin as reasonable measures for public safety. But individuals could be targeted. The South African state used its surveillance apparatus to spy on Sam Sole, an investigative journalist and his source in the National Prosecuting Authority (Duncan 2021), demonstrating just how vulnerable the system is to abuse.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>In Exhausting a Crowd footage, users can use tags and comment on individuals and other street objects. The messages are innocent and sometimes funny. But it is not difficult to imagine how a surveillance state could use such features to profile people. Members of the public could be forced to tag the undesirable behaviour of individuals in public. The tags could then be used to punish or reward behaviour. Such an undertaking has already begun in China with its one of a kind social credit system that allows unprecedented collection and classification of data by businesses and government to form individual profiles (Kobie 2019).</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p>The coronavirus pandemic turned the entire world into the streets of Braamfontein. Nobody felt safe. People willingly and understandably supplied governments with the means to expand mass surveillance capabilities. A government not monitoring its citizen’s movements would be labelled as careless. But similar to how Exhausting a Crowd is still up years after it was commissioned, researchers predict that surveillance practices of the pandemic will continue even after the virus is contained (Swart 2021). </p>\r\n           \r\n          \r\n            <h2>References </h2>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li> Duncan, J. 2021. <a href=\"https://aboutintel.eu/south-africa-surveillance-ruling/\" target=\"blank\">The global significance of South Africa’s mass surveillance ruling.</a></li>\r\n                <li> Kobie, N. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained\" target=\"blank\">The complicated truth about China’s social credit system.</a></li>\r\n                <li> Swart, H. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-09-06-hello-this-is-your-government-speaking-rise-of-global-surveillance-practices-during-covid-has-insights-for-south-africa/\" target=\"blank\"> Hello, this is your government speaking: Rise of global surveillance practices during Covid has insights for South Africa.</a></li>\r\n\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ExhaustingACrowd;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/blog art.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction TechnicalReflection2({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Assignment 2 Technical Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"internet art by Khutso Nkadimeng\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Internet Art - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>is either not working or not fully functional. I was, however, able to build <a href=\"blog-art.html\" target=\"blank\">the experience I wanted</a>  using vanilla JavaScript. With constant four-hour-long power cuts and a non-functional project, my experience was like reading an article from the South side of my website. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Process </strong>\r\n            <p>I built a <a href=\"internet-art.html\" target=\"blank\">prototype </a> in Assignment 1 and came into the second assignment to build onto that existing idea. I knew what I wanted to do and how it should work using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM). Thus, that is what I started with. I built the experience in JavaScript DOM as part of my first website. Once everything was working as intended in the DOM, I would then transfer it into React. Half that plan was less than successful. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Struggles</strong>\r\n            <p>I am relatively comfortable with the complexity of JavaScript necessary to build my website. I thought that skill would be easily transferable; after all, React JS is another way to use the same language. I could not have been more wrong. My mistake was even more fundamental than I first realised. Building websites in React actually takes a different type of thinking. The one major difference which was consequential in my case was that in React, you do not directly manipulate the DOM. The way the DOM works is no different to basic Object Oriented programming. If you want to change a value in a class, you just access it using the class name and dot property. But React is different; things are done through reference to avoid rendering every time a component state changes. As a result, the difference is like that between manipulating values directly and through pointers in C++. My design approach was not adapted to that.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>My thinking was, “how can I adapt this functionality to React” instead of “what properties of React can allow me the same functionality”. So, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to directly manipulate the DOM in React. The very thing React was designed to minimise. Needless to say, I failed because I could not achieve the same functionality as I did with JavaScript DOM. Even my buttons, an integral part of my site, do not work as intended.  I also struggled with breaking my existing pages into small and reusable components for the most part. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Solution</strong>\r\n            <p>With the problem of non-functional components in React, my solution was to use links and direct the user to my <a href=\"index.html\" target=\"blank\">functional website</a>. For example, the Blog section in React links to the working Blog section built using JavaScript DOM. This is a temporary solution I intend to address in future adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Achievements</strong>\r\n            <p>Although things were broken in React, my JavaScript works as intended. It is responsive and very interactive. I managed to show what the vision of the project is. I am especially pleased with the Blog section, I wanted to turn that section into my internet art, and I successfully did. Although React was in many ways a disaster, I did see the advantages it provides. I do not have to code or build the same component many times. Using just one with good props can save countless hours. I managed to do that with my navigations. That was the best part, learning something new and useful. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n            <p>This assignment was overall a humbling experience. There is so much I need to learn in a short period of time. But after this much struggle, I am very determined. </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TechnicalReflection2;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/proposal.jpeg\";\r\n\r\nfunction ExamArtProposal({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Internet Art Rationale</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"writing a proposal\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Wriring a proposal-Pixels</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Description</strong>\r\n            <p>As internet art, I propose to you, North South. North South is a site built as an abstraction of internet access inequalities and economic disparities of the Global North and South with a direct focus on the most unequal society in the world, South Africa. The site leverages web features such as interactivity to create small differences in experiences that can make a huge difference to the user.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Visitors will likely be curious after landing on a home page with plain contrasting black and white colours and a few words with no explanation on a site that is supposed to be about internet art. But the site is not about internet art, it is itself, a piece of art designed to be explored and experienced. After going through the art and blog sections of the site, everything will start to make sense. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>North South consist mainly of two features, the first one being a split-screen dividing the North and the South and the second is a group of buttons used to interact with the site. At first glance, everything will look the same, but just like in life, there is an underlying structural issue making things difficult for some parts of society. The user will likely end up using the North side of the website more frequently. Just like all of us would want a slightly or even more comfortable life than we lead. And that is the point of this artwork, to show that while in Alexander, we all want to cross the road into Sandton.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Theoretical Focus</strong>\r\n            <p>Focusing more on South Africa, the theoretical framework throughout the website is on Internet, Society and Design Justice. With more attention to the socio-economic conditions driving the growing digital divide in the country and beyond.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Rationale </strong>\r\n            <p>North South was designed to be a single integrated internet art as opposed to multiple art prototypes hosted on a site. The reason for that is twofold: first as is simply an artistic choice. I wanted to build something that looks simple at first glance but has deeper meaning complexity as you go deeper. The second is about my theoretical focus. I felt that the topic is too broad and very important and therefore needs a sustained focus and elaborate representation. </p>\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            <p>The site is by design, minimalistic. I aimed to provide the essence of disparities between neighbouring communities in South Africa. Thus, the focus was on building interactive and meaningful experiences to give the user an idea of what its like to live in an environment of constant struggle right next to someone living in affluence. To achieve that, I needed to create an environment that allows something similar to a dialogue. To facilitate dialogue, one does not need fancy conference rooms, a chair under a tree is just as effective. What matters is the conversation being had  .</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Reflection </strong>\r\n            <p>I believe I have succeeded in my goal to make a coherent and integrated website. As a form of internet, I do not believe there is anything lacking in my work. There are a few hard technical choices I had to make which are meant to avoid the site crushing. If users are not aware that they must use the internal navigation of the artwork, the site may crush. But otherwise, my implementation is excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ExamArtProposal;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/home.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction ExamArtisticReflection({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Artistic Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Reading through all my artistic reflections, a theme emerges. From the beginning, I wanted to build a project in which my art and technical implementation are fully aligned with the theory I am engaging. I am now confident that I succeeded in this regard. </p>\r\n          \r\n            \r\n            <p>My theoretical focus was Internet, Society and Design Justice, and in particular, internet access inequality and the economic disparities that go with it. I engaged with the readings and wrote about the growing digital gap exacerbated by the global pandemic and how it resulted in low-income earners losing jobs and their children having to drop out of school. Simultaneously, resourced schools and families were able to access resources and quickly adapted to the new normal. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>I did not just write about this problem and treat my theory as simply a requirement, I was able to find a creative way to build that theory into a piece of art. Without reading my reflections and artwork descriptions, the reader can understand my website and internet art by reading my theoretical analysis. The internet artworks I have chosen to analyse are also perfectly aligned with my project. Take for example The Revolving Internet, it’s an abstract idea that at first glance look like a simple rotation of the Google home page. But closer analysis reveals just how much meaning there is in that rotation. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>I wanted to build something like The Revolving Internet, a simple looking concept that creatively combines art, theory and technical implementation and I have. For this exam I had to make one big design choice, I designed my website to rely on internal navigation buttons. By that I mean for a better experience, the user must use navigation buttons I have provided and not those from the browser. I have explained this decision in the technical reflection but basically, I had to abandon traditional page linking and use the state property of React to control the blog part of my website.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My technical decision had artistic ramifications. For example, I had to add the back button of my own because it is important to allow the user to still have a familiar browsing experience. To be able to properly navigate my website. On that subject of navigation, I have removed the menu buttons in the blog section and for mobile. The blog will most likely be the section the user spends the most time on. I have provided a way to navigate through all the blogs and did not see a reason for the navbar in that section and therefore allowed users to go back to the home page once they are done with blogs. </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ExamArtisticReflection;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/blog art.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction ExamTechnicalReflection({SetArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">North</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Technical Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My approach to Assignment 2 was ill-informed. After building a fully functional website covering my whole project vision in JavaScript (JS), I thought rewriting it in React JS would be a simple matter of changing a few structural elements and syntax. That was a mistake. A mistake that I came in this exam intending to rectify. My goal for this exam project was to rebuild my website and internet art in React and achieve the same functionality and experience as in vanilla JavaScript. </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h3>Process</h3>\r\n            <p>The first and most important part of the process was having the correct mentality. Instead of thinking about ways to covert a JS website into React as I did in Assignment 2, I started thinking about React features that would enable me to build my idea. And just like I did at the beginning of this course, I started by building a prototype. My prototype art is a split-screen experience where the user can scroll through images on the North and South side of the screen and feel the differences. After a successful implementation, I then turned my attention to the blog section of my website to build up on the prototype idea and make it a core experience of my website. That was not easy.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Challenges</h3>\r\n            <p>What made my split-screen blog experience possible and relatively easy to implement in vanilla JS was the iframe tag. Iframe allowed me to effectively run my whole website in parallel using the same code. But I was not going to have the same privilege in React. The problem with iframe is that it requires a source, which must be an HTML page, however, all our components in React are JS files. A simple solution to my problem was to use my vanilla JS website as the source to my iframe in React. That would have saved me a lot of stress. However, I felt that it defeats the purpose of learning React, I had to find a React solution to my problem. Besides that, iframes had their own issue. You could render one iframe into another, which meant that you could run a page inside itself infinitely. That is appealing at first but after a few loops, the page gets cluttered.   </p>\r\n             <p>Another more consequential challenge I faced was that of manipulating opacity dynamically in React. The way my blogs work is that over time visibility is lost and the user must perform a few tasks to restore pages into a more readable state. To do that I directly manipulated the Document Object Model (DOM) in JS.  React is built to avoid exactly that type of manipulation for it to be fast. A solution to this problem meant giving up certain common features like the browser’s back button and replacing them with my own.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Solution</h3>\r\n            <p>To address the absence of an iframe I used React’s ability to render one component inside another. This feature also allows conditional rendering based on the state of the website. I developed the logic to make a split-screen parallel experience without the use of an iframe and in that process, solved the problem of infinite self-rendering of pages. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>To manipulate opacity, I used the useRef hook. But the hook comes with its set of challenges. Since I am only using a reference and not accessing the property directly, I sometimes found that the reference I am looking for is not available during rendering times. And that leads to TypeErrors of undefined style properties. To solve that, I stopped using links in my blog pages. Everything is controlled using states. This way I was able to control all the necessary aspects of my website.

Post-modernism is the rejection of enlightenment <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/postmodernism-philosophy\" target=\"blank\">(Duignan 2020)</a>, the foundation of modernism and is a general suspicion of authority. In this article, I will argue that <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a> can be classified as modernist art and its purposes align with post-modern philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Google is not the internet, but it is a very good abstraction, and it is practically synonymous with the internet. It is therefore fitting to call this artefact <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>. To create meaning, the artist simply changed the orientation of google pages and left everything else to function the same</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Our perception of Google is of an archive of the truth. I cannot count how many times I have heard people say things like “I am telling you the truth; you can even google it”. By rotating the Google website, Constant Dullaart, the author of <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>, demonstrates to us that even Google can be manipulated. Bringing us to the postmodern view that there is no absolute truth. Truth is relative. Perhaps a good example of this concept can be demonstrated with a Google search. In 2018, the result of the search terms “squatter camps in South Africa” had many South Africans surprised because the results showed white people <a href=\"https://qz.com/africa/1306782/why-googling-squatter-camps-in-south-africa-returns-pictures-of-white-people/\" target=\"blank\">(Chuttel 2018)</a>. There are many struggling white people in South Africa; however, people expected the Google results to feature more black people because that is the reality on the ground. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>For someone in a foreign country who used the stated search terms without much knowledge about South Africa, the truth is, squatter camps are predominantly white. That is true and they have Google to prove it. Nobody stops to ask themselves how the search algorithms work and whose answers are likely to appear at the top. This goes back to the inequalities of internet access and online material contributions. The postmodernists believe that all forms of knowledge are functions of power. In this case, they are right.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Amazingly, such a simple concept of a rotating screen can have so much meaning. My own approach to internet art was partly inspired by <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-revolving-internet\" target=\"blank\">The Revolving Internet</a>. I want to combine many basic ideas for a meaningful experience.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>References</h2>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li>Kuiper, K. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/art/Modernism-art\" target=\"blank\">Britannica.

My site is functional, navigation is good for mobile, and pc and I managed to make a satisfactory prototype of my internet art idea. I did however experience issues with the responsiveness of my art page and reusing code for my split-screen. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Process </strong>\r\n            <p>The priority was to get the basics working. That means functional navigation and responsiveness of the usual pages like <a href=\"index.html\" target=\"blank\">homepage</a> and <a href=\"blog.html\" target=\"blank\">blog entries</a>. Once that was working, I focused all my attention on internet art. For internet art the priority was functionality. I wanted to build a convincing and working minimum viable product. After a struggle, I finally pulled it off. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Struggle with responsiveness</strong>\r\n            <p>Responsiveness of the normal sections of the site was not that difficult. There were difficulties with getting the site to work just as well on mobile phones in landscape orientation. However, everything worked well for a portrait one. For the internet art page, there is a unique challenge. A split-screen of a mobile phone makes smaller square screens. Too small to give a similar computer experience. And it cannot give both portrait and landscape experiences of a mobile phone. A more optimal solution in the future may have to be completely different pages for the North and South sides in mobile. That is something I am currently considering.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>I also had issues with reusing code from the North in the South. The differences are small enough to be managed by two or three more variables. However, I had problems trying to give arguments to an onClick event. That meant I had to repeat the same code twice with a few variable name changes</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Achievements</strong>\r\n            <p>I eventually figured out how arguments work using event listeners. I successfully used the method on a few functions, but my internet art behaved differently. I still see that as a victory. I believe there is something small I was doing wrong without noticing and I will now have a chance to investigate it closely. A functional prototype of my internet art vision is also a big achievement for me. It functions exactly how I intended, and it was built using simple concepts. I also like the menu in the middle of the homepage road. It makes sense that to go anywhere on my site you must use the road. It also provides me with enough space for more things in the future.   </p>\r\n         \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthTechnicalReflection;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/home.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthArtisticReflection({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Assignment 1 Artistic Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 03 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My life has so far proven to have unlimited reserves of artistic raw materials waiting to be mined. Just like many students I lead a life of two halves. One in the city, and then there is home during holidays. With almost two years under lockdown due to the pandemic, it should not matter much where I am, but it does. Turning these two worlds into one requires, at least in my case, a constant and affordable internet access. To use the internet at home the way I am now in Johannesburg would cost me the same if not more than the rent I am paying in the city. That is partly what I am trying to highlight with my internet art </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h3>Vision</h3>\r\n            <p>I do not just want to build a site as a pathway to my internet art. I want the website to be the art. The homogeneity must begin with the home page and spread with every page and content. My aim is to simulate the inequalities of the world we live in using the properties of the internet. I want to speak to the disparities of the Global North and the Global South, especially in the context of the creation of all technology tools that now run our lives. Unfortunately, as a South African, I do not have to travel the world to witness the implications of global inequality. I have samples scattered throughout the country. The North and the South are  <a href=\"https://unequalscenes.com/south-africa\" target=\"blank\">separated by a road</a> in South Africa. That is what I am building as an interactive internet experience. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Process</h3>\r\n            <p>Minimalism is the style guiding my process. I wanted to say as much as possible using as little as possible. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Homepage</strong>\r\n            <p>My homepage  made me appreciate just how difficult is it to make a good minimal design. My home page does not explicitly say what my project is about. But I wanted to use representations to inform the visitor. Starting with the name, my site is called North South. Which indicates polar opposites, and the global context of my project. I then use black and white colours and a tar road separating them. This is in reference to the racial inequalities in South Africa. The words standing out more than even the title is “ThisUnity in Diversity”. That is a word play on the South African motto, Unity in Diversity. However, I am trying to show Disunity. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Pages</strong>\r\n            <p>For blog pages I decided to stick to my minimalist idea. I keep the consistent black and white colours and just keep everything clean.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Internet Art</strong>\r\n            <p>With internet art I wanted to demonstrate how people living side by side have such a different online experience. Certain things look the same on the surface, but they are not. In the case of my project, you need to buy data to go through the pictures and to buy data you need money. In both the North and South you generate money by simply clicking on a button. However, you earn four times more in the North, data costs five times less and the internet is four times faster.  </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthArtisticReflection;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/proposal.jpeg\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthInternetArtProposal({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Internet Art Proposal</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Writing with a pen and paper\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Writing a proposal- Pexels</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 04 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <strong>Description </strong>\r\n            <p>My internet art is a simulation of inequalities that exist next to each other in many South African cities. It is also designed in reference to the disparities of the Global North and South.  I am using properties of the web to give an experience of two contrasting worlds existing directly next to each other. I will have a split-screen for the North and South. Users will be able to switch between the two and experience both sides. On the North side, the internet is cheaper and faster, and people make more money. On the South side is the opposite, the internet is expensive and slower, and people make less money. More activities and features will be added to make these differences more apparent. An optimal expression of my idea is turning it into a browser. That is, you can do almost all activities you normally do on the internet. But you are limited by the constraints I put in like loading times, lack of data, lack of money, load-shedding, general access restrictions, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Theoretical Focus</strong>\r\n            <p>My theoretical focus is on Internet, Society and Design Justice in the context of South Africa. The digital divide we are experiencing in South Africa mirrors historical inequalities, societal hierarchies, and exclusive urban planning. I am concerned with differences in data costs, hardware accessibility and infrastructure development. All these factors are a result of economic disparities and that is the picture I am trying to paint overall.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Style Guide and Reference Materials</strong>\r\n            <p>To give an idea of what I am trying to build, I have provided a prototype on the <a href=\"internet-art.html\" target=\"blank\">internet art page</a>. I have made a split-screen of the North and South. Users browse through images showing the type of environment I am simulating. But the browsing experience is different. Data in the North costs 2.5% of the salary, but in the South, it costs 50%. Internet in the South is four times slower than in the North.

The name is in reference to the Global North and Global South, a concept used to classify world countries based on their socio-economic and political characteristics.  Countries making up the Global North are wealthier, more politically stable, and less unequal. The Global South consists of poorer, unequal, and unstable countries. South Africa is somewhat unique; as an uncontested leader of inequality in the world, South Africa is structured like two countries divided along racial lines. A white country for the Global North and a black country in the Global South.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Slums occupied by black people and affluent suburbs formerly designated for white people exist side by side and still reflect historical demographics designed by the Apartheid state of South Africa. Without basic infrastructures such as electricity and telecommunication lines, internet access is multiple times more expensive in townships than in the neighbouring suburbs. People in the townships earn far less than their suburban counterparts; as a result, they spend a higher percentage of their earnings on internet connection.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My internet art is an abstract representation of this reality. The art is a model of a typical unequal area in South Africa. A model of the place's physical characteristics and an expression of a way of life accompanying these neighbouring contrasting areas. North-South is Sandton-Alexander and Primrose-Makause on the internet.</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p>The stark black and white colours separated by small to no boundaries are the black and white neighbours of these areas, the rich and the poor, the digitally connected and the excluded groups. The North side of the website is designed to be relatively smooth and mire resourced, and the South side is made to be slow, frustrating, work-intensive with a high cost of operation. These are the daily realities of South Africans. </p>\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthInternetArtDescription;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/global-internet.jpg\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthGlobalInternet({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>The Need for Global Internet Connection -A close Reading</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"global internet picture\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>A connected world - Pixabay</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          \r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 07 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <p>For years the internet was seen as the solution to all problems the world faced due to physical, socio-political, and cultural barriers. True democracy was on the horizon. Free access to education offered by some of the world’s best educators. Free access to global markets for anyone anywhere on earth. In the internet world, the only limitation people would have to contend with would be themselves. But the internet had a far easier idea, to simply retrace inequalities of the past.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>According to Claire Daniolou there is only about 59% of the global population with internet access as of 2020 (Daniolou 2020). A further breakdown by UNESCO shows that “in the developed world, 87% are connected compared with 47% in developing nations, and just 19% in the least developed countries.” (Broom 2020) The historical parallels are not just international trends. Numbers from Stats SA 2019 report showed Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa with the highest internet penetration at 72.2% and Limpopo with only 42.4% of its population online (Stats SA 2019).</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Effects</strong>\r\n\r\n            <p>The differences in online presence result in greater inequality because, unlike Gauteng, a place like Limpopo will most likely “have larger populations with lower levels of educational attainment, lower-income, and more restricted access to healthcare and travel services”. (Daniolou 2020) In 2020, Ndlovu Youth Choir made many South Africans proud by reaching the finals of America’s Got Talent. The choir comes from a few kilometres away from my village, but I had to discover them with the rest of the world. These were supposed to be YouTube stars around the community, but digital isolation prevents such unique cultural products from flourishing, as Daniolou has correctly identified. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Action</strong>\r\n          \r\n            <p>Many originations, governments and businesses are working on solutions to bring broadband connectivity to rural areas (Daniolou 2020). I am particularly inspired by stories such as the one from Mankosi village in Eastern Cape. The University of Western Cape helped community members build an Internet Service Provider themselves, the first of its kind in South Africa, named Zenzele Network Providers – Zenzele means “do it yourself” in isiXhosa (Sikhakhane 2017). Help may or may not come, but those of us who are affected by issues must try solving them ourselves however we can. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Results</strong>\r\n           \r\n            <p>Zenzele Network Providers is now an established business, and community members buy vouchers to access the network at prices way below the national average. R30 will get you uncapped internet for a month. The opportunities for Mankosi residences are endless. The is no flaw in Daniolou statement that the internet “plays an imperative role in the business world” (Daniolou 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Dangers</strong>\r\n\r\n            <p>There is no doubt that “Online information can be misleading, so without a critical thinking, parts of the digital population can be manipulated” (Daniolou 2020). Some cases are nothing if not extraordinary. When Coronavirus began ravaging the world in 2020, people believed fake news linking the virus to 5G technology (Fransman 2021). But that was not a good enough leap; they went as far as attacking telecommunication towers. It is through education that such issues may be avoided. </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h2>References </h2>\r\n\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li> Daniolou, C. 2020. <a href=\"https://www.internetjustsociety.org/the-need-for-global-internet-connectivity\" target=\"blank\">Institute for Internet and the Just Society:  Digital Divide Widens.</a></li>\r\n                \r\n                <li> Broom, D. 2020.  <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-digital-divide-internet-data-broadband-mobbile/\" target=\"blank\"> Coronavirus has exposed the digital divide like never before.</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Stats SA. 2019. <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0318/P03182016.pdf\" target=\"blank\">STATISTICAL RELEASE P0318</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Sikhakhane, J. 2017. <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/how-a-rural-community-built-south-africas-first-isp-owned-and-run-by-a-cooperative-87448\" target=\"blank\">How a rural community built South Africa’s first ISP owned and run by a cooperative</a></li>\r\n               \r\n                <li> Fransman, F. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/news24/columnists/guestcolumn/opinion-the-5g-effect-and-covid-conspiracies-why-these-notions-must-be-dispelled-20210408\" target=\"blank\">The 5G effect and Covid conspiracies: Why these notions must be dispelled</a></li>\r\n    \r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthGlobalInternet;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/Crowd2.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthExhaustingACrowd({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Analysis of Exhausting a Crowd</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Exhausting a Crowd in the Netherlands\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Exhausting a Crowd in the Netherlands</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n          \r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 07 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <p>I am a believer in the idea that, in general, there are no socio-political solutions; there are only trade-offs. Walking around the streets of Braamfontein, I have never really felt safe, and I keep asking myself, what would I give up in exchange for security. Am I willing to give up some of my freedoms to state surveillance machinery in hopes of neutralising the criminal element roaming the streets with such ease? But this is where the nuance lies. Authorities do not ask for our willingness to be monitored; they just do it. Exhausting a Crowd is a reminder of that reality.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Judging by the camera positioning and location, scenes from Exhausting a Crowd would be classified as untargeted and ethically questionable public surveillance. South Africa introduced mass surveillance through the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication Related Information Act, or RICA, after the September 11 attacks in the United States (Duncan 2021). Such programs begin as reasonable measures for public safety. But individuals could be targeted. The South African state used its surveillance apparatus to spy on Sam Sole, an investigative journalist and his source in the National Prosecuting Authority (Duncan 2021), demonstrating just how vulnerable the system is to abuse.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>In Exhausting a Crowd footage, users can use tags and comment on individuals and other street objects. The messages are innocent and sometimes funny. But it is not difficult to imagine how a surveillance state could use such features to profile people. Members of the public could be forced to tag the undesirable behaviour of individuals in public. The tags could then be used to punish or reward behaviour. Such an undertaking has already begun in China with its one of a kind social credit system that allows unprecedented collection and classification of data by businesses and government to form individual profiles (Kobie 2019).</p>\r\n          \r\n            <p>The coronavirus pandemic turned the entire world into the streets of Braamfontein. Nobody felt safe. People willingly and understandably supplied governments with the means to expand mass surveillance capabilities. A government not monitoring its citizen’s movements would be labelled as careless. But similar to how Exhausting a Crowd is still up years after it was commissioned, researchers predict that surveillance practices of the pandemic will continue even after the virus is contained (Swart 2021). </p>\r\n           \r\n          \r\n            <h2>References </h2>\r\n            <ol>\r\n                <li> Duncan, J. 2021. <a href=\"https://aboutintel.eu/south-africa-surveillance-ruling/\" target=\"blank\">The global significance of South Africa’s mass surveillance ruling.</a></li>\r\n                <li> Kobie, N. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained\" target=\"blank\">The complicated truth about China’s social credit system.</a></li>\r\n                <li> Swart, H. 2021. <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-09-06-hello-this-is-your-government-speaking-rise-of-global-surveillance-practices-during-covid-has-insights-for-south-africa/\" target=\"blank\"> Hello, this is your government speaking: Rise of global surveillance practices during Covid has insights for South Africa.</a></li>\r\n\r\n            </ol>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthExhaustingACrowd;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/blog art.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthTechnicalReflection2({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Assignment 2 Technical Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"internet art by Khutso Nkadimeng\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Internet Art - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Oct 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>is either not working or not fully functional. I was, however, able to build <a href=\"blog-art.html\" target=\"blank\">the experience I wanted</a>  using vanilla JavaScript. With constant four-hour-long power cuts and a non-functional project, my experience was like reading an article from the South side of my website. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Process </strong>\r\n            <p>I built a <a href=\"internet-art.html\" target=\"blank\">prototype </a> in Assignment 1 and came into the second assignment to build onto that existing idea. I knew what I wanted to do and how it should work using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM). Thus, that is what I started with. I built the experience in JavaScript DOM as part of my first website. Once everything was working as intended in the DOM, I would then transfer it into React. Half that plan was less than successful. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Struggles</strong>\r\n            <p>I am relatively comfortable with the complexity of JavaScript necessary to build my website. I thought that skill would be easily transferable; after all, React JS is another way to use the same language. I could not have been more wrong. My mistake was even more fundamental than I first realised. Building websites in React actually takes a different type of thinking. The one major difference which was consequential in my case was that in React, you do not directly manipulate the DOM. The way the DOM works is no different to basic Object Oriented programming. If you want to change a value in a class, you just access it using the class name and dot property. But React is different; things are done through reference to avoid rendering every time a component state changes. As a result, the difference is like that between manipulating values directly and through pointers in C++. My design approach was not adapted to that.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>My thinking was, “how can I adapt this functionality to React” instead of “what properties of React can allow me the same functionality”. So, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to directly manipulate the DOM in React. The very thing React was designed to minimise. Needless to say, I failed because I could not achieve the same functionality as I did with JavaScript DOM. Even my buttons, an integral part of my site, do not work as intended.  I also struggled with breaking my existing pages into small and reusable components for the most part. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Solution</strong>\r\n            <p>With the problem of non-functional components in React, my solution was to use links and direct the user to my <a href=\"index.html\" target=\"blank\">functional website</a>. For example, the Blog section in React links to the working Blog section built using JavaScript DOM. This is a temporary solution I intend to address in future adequately.</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Achievements</strong>\r\n            <p>Although things were broken in React, my JavaScript works as intended. It is responsive and very interactive. I managed to show what the vision of the project is. I am especially pleased with the Blog section, I wanted to turn that section into my internet art, and I successfully did. Although React was in many ways a disaster, I did see the advantages it provides. I do not have to code or build the same component many times. Using just one with good props can save countless hours. I managed to do that with my navigations. That was the best part, learning something new and useful. </p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n            <p>This assignment was overall a humbling experience. There is so much I need to learn in a short period of time. But after this much struggle, I am very determined. </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthTechnicalReflection2;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/proposal.jpeg\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthExamArtProposal({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Internet Art Rationale</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"writing a proposal\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>Wriring a proposal-Pixels</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Description</strong>\r\n            <p>As internet art, I propose to you, North South. North South is a site built as an abstraction of internet access inequalities and economic disparities of the Global North and South with a direct focus on the most unequal society in the world, South Africa. The site leverages web features such as interactivity to create small differences in experiences that can make a huge difference to the user.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Visitors will likely be curious after landing on a home page with plain contrasting black and white colours and a few words with no explanation on a site that is supposed to be about internet art. But the site is not about internet art, it is itself, a piece of art designed to be explored and experienced. After going through the art and blog sections of the site, everything will start to make sense. </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>North South consist mainly of two features, the first one being a split-screen dividing the North and the South and the second is a group of buttons used to interact with the site. At first glance, everything will look the same, but just like in life, there is an underlying structural issue making things difficult for some parts of society. The user will likely end up using the North side of the website more frequently. Just like all of us would want a slightly or even more comfortable life than we lead. And that is the point of this artwork, to show that while in Alexander, we all want to cross the road into Sandton.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Theoretical Focus</strong>\r\n            <p>Focusing more on South Africa, the theoretical framework throughout the website is on Internet, Society and Design Justice. With more attention to the socio-economic conditions driving the growing digital divide in the country and beyond.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <strong>Rationale </strong>\r\n            <p>North South was designed to be a single integrated internet art as opposed to multiple art prototypes hosted on a site. The reason for that is twofold: first as is simply an artistic choice. I wanted to build something that looks simple at first glance but has deeper meaning complexity as you go deeper. The second is about my theoretical focus. I felt that the topic is too broad and very important and therefore needs a sustained focus and elaborate representation. </p>\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            <p>The site is by design, minimalistic. I aimed to provide the essence of disparities between neighbouring communities in South Africa. Thus, the focus was on building interactive and meaningful experiences to give the user an idea of what its like to live in an environment of constant struggle right next to someone living in affluence. To achieve that, I needed to create an environment that allows something similar to a dialogue. To facilitate dialogue, one does not need fancy conference rooms, a chair under a tree is just as effective. What matters is the conversation being had  .</p>\r\n\r\n            <strong>Reflection </strong>\r\n            \r\n            <p>I believe I have succeeded in my goal to make a coherent and integrated website. As a form of internet, I do not believe there is anything lacking in my work. There are a few hard technical choices I had to make which are meant to avoid the site crushing. If users are not aware that they must use the internal navigation of the artwork, the site may crush. But otherwise, my implementation is excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthExamArtProposal;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/home.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthExamArtisticReflection({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Artistic Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>Reading through all my artistic reflections, a theme emerges. From the beginning, I wanted to build a project in which my art and technical implementation are fully aligned with the theory I am engaging. I am now confident that I succeeded in this regard. </p>\r\n          \r\n            \r\n            <p>My theoretical focus was Internet, Society and Design Justice, and in particular, internet access inequality and the economic disparities that go with it. I engaged with the readings and wrote about the growing digital gap exacerbated by the global pandemic and how it resulted in low-income earners losing jobs and their children having to drop out of school. Simultaneously, resourced schools and families were able to access resources and quickly adapted to the new normal. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>I did not just write about this problem and treat my theory as simply a requirement, I was able to find a creative way to build that theory into a piece of art. Without reading my reflections and artwork descriptions, the reader can understand my website and internet art by reading my theoretical analysis. The internet artworks I have chosen to analyse are also perfectly aligned with my project. Take for example The Revolving Internet, it’s an abstract idea that at first glance look like a simple rotation of the Google home page. But closer analysis reveals just how much meaning there is in that rotation. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>I wanted to build something like The Revolving Internet, a simple looking concept that creatively combines art, theory and technical implementation and I have. For this exam I had to make one big design choice, I designed my website to rely on internal navigation buttons. By that I mean for a better experience, the user must use navigation buttons I have provided and not those from the browser. I have explained this decision in the technical reflection but basically, I had to abandon traditional page linking and use the state property of React to control the blog part of my website.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My technical decision had artistic ramifications. For example, I had to add the back button of my own because it is important to allow the user to still have a familiar browsing experience. To be able to properly navigate my website. On that subject of navigation, I have removed the menu buttons in the blog section and for mobile. The blog will most likely be the section the user spends the most time on. I have provided a way to navigate through all the blogs and did not see a reason for the navbar in that section and therefore allowed users to go back to the home page once they are done with blogs. </p>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthExamArtisticReflection;","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport blogCSS from \"../allblogStyle.module.css\";\r\n\r\nimport art from \"../images/blog art.PNG\";\r\n\r\nfunction SouthExamTechnicalReflection({SetSouthArticle}){\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className={blogCSS.mainContainer}>\r\n      <h1 className={blogCSS.regularHomeButton} onClick = {()=>{{SetSouthArticle(0)}}}>\r\n        <Link to=\"#\">South</Link>\r\n      </h1>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.ScrollButtons}>\r\n              <div className={blogCSS.backButton} onClick = {()=>{ {SetSouthArticle(0)}}} >\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>    \r\n      \r\n      <div className={blogCSS.restOfNavButtons}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.color}></div>\r\n\r\n      <div className={blogCSS.articleBackground}>\r\n        <div className={blogCSS.container}>\r\n          <h1 className={blogCSS.pageHeadings}>Exam Technical Reflection</h1>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n            <img src={art} width=\"100%\" alt=\"Home page of North South\"></img>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n\r\n            <em>North South Web Homepage - Khutso Nkadimeng</em>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            <p>By Khutso Nkadimeng, 09 Dec 2021</p>\r\n            <br></br>\r\n            \r\n            <p>My approach to Assignment 2 was ill-informed. After building a fully functional website covering my whole project vision in JavaScript (JS), I thought rewriting it in React JS would be a simple matter of changing a few structural elements and syntax. That was a mistake. A mistake that I came in this exam intending to rectify. My goal for this exam project was to rebuild my website and internet art in React and achieve the same functionality and experience as in vanilla JavaScript. </p>\r\n          \r\n            <h3>Process</h3>\r\n            <p>The first and most important part of the process was having the correct mentality. Instead of thinking about ways to covert a JS website into React as I did in Assignment 2, I started thinking about React features that would enable me to build my idea. And just like I did at the beginning of this course, I started by building a prototype. My prototype art is a split-screen experience where the user can scroll through images on the North and South side of the screen and feel the differences. After a successful implementation, I then turned my attention to the blog section of my website to build up on the prototype idea and make it a core experience of my website. That was not easy.  </p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Challenges</h3>\r\n            <p>What made my split-screen blog experience possible and relatively easy to implement in vanilla JS was the iframe tag. Iframe allowed me to effectively run my whole website in parallel using the same code. But I was not going to have the same privilege in React. The problem with iframe is that it requires a source, which must be an HTML page, however, all our components in React are JS files. A simple solution to my problem was to use my vanilla JS website as the source to my iframe in React. That would have saved me a lot of stress. However, I felt that it defeats the purpose of learning React, I had to find a React solution to my problem. Besides that, iframes had their own issue. You could render one iframe into another, which meant that you could run a page inside itself infinitely. That is appealing at first but after a few loops, the page gets cluttered.   </p>\r\n             <p>Another more consequential challenge I faced was that of manipulating opacity dynamically in React. The way my blogs work is that over time visibility is lost and the user must perform a few tasks to restore pages into a more readable state. To do that I directly manipulated the Document Object Model (DOM) in JS.  React is built to avoid exactly that type of manipulation for it to be fast. A solution to this problem meant giving up certain common features like the browser’s back button and replacing them with my own.</p>\r\n            \r\n            <h3>Solution</h3>\r\n            <p>To address the absence of an iframe I used React’s ability to render one component inside another. This feature also allows conditional rendering based on the state of the website. I developed the logic to make a split-screen parallel experience without the use of an iframe and in that process, solved the problem of infinite self-rendering of pages. </p>\r\n            \r\n            <p>To manipulate opacity, I used the useRef hook. But the hook comes with its set of challenges. Since I am only using a reference and not accessing the property directly, I sometimes found that the reference I am looking for is not available during rendering times. And that leads to TypeErrors of undefined style properties. To solve that, I stopped using links in my blog pages. Everything is controlled using states. This way I was able to control all the necessary aspects of my website. So, for a better experience, users must navigate my site using the methods I have supplied, not those of the browser.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>Conclution</h3>\r\n            <p>This assignment was tough, but I am happy with the project and my progress as a student. My site is responsive, integrated and shows genuine and successful experimentation with new technology. I went from one challenge to another coming up with novel and interesting solutions. In the end, I produced what I envisioned.  </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SouthExamTechnicalReflection;","import React from 'react'\r\nimport {
